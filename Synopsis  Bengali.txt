Bitonko, 'pigeons coops', is the story of the man or woman from all spheres of life and living. The play provides us with a window to the constant battle between the conscious and the subconscious. The conscious fights another battle within itself as one part of it still belongs to its subconscious sweetheart yet it itself stubs the burning rebel in the ashtray where its heart now resides. It's easy to fit in, it's easier to be in the world of myriad thoughts, cultures and expressions if only the soul knows where to find the home. But, when a tornado meets a volcano, the result is rarely pleasant - a shell that bursts within itself.
